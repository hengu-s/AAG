# AAG
A python program to completely automate Marvel Snap gameplay by using Agatha Harkness. 

********** Program poorly created by hengu-s on 12/05/2023 **********

NOTE:
This program was meant to run on the game Marvel Snap.
If you are not using the program for the game, do not expect it to run without some tweaking

This program must have pyautogui and pynput installed to correctly run
Please Google these libraries to install them as I do not own them...

I recommend to not use any decks with magik or wave as these cards stop the agatha AI from continuing

This program was made very quickly and bare-bonesly, so tweak it to your liking to improve it

And as always, enjoy!
